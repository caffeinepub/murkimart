  "summary": "The diff implements a ProfileSummary component added to the Home page bottom, covering most of REQ-38 requirements. The component displays user info from authStore, a Login/Sign Up prompt when not authenticated, four quick-link cards with icons, and a 'Go to Profile' button. However, there is a placement issue: the ProfileSummary is placed after FlashDeals, not directly below CustomerCareContact as specified.",

      "requirement": "The profile/account summary section should be placed below the CustomerCareContact banner and above any footer padding (not below FlashDeals).",
      "reason": "In Home.tsx, the ProfileSummary component is placed after FlashDeals, not directly below CustomerCareContact. The order is: CustomerCareContact → FlashDeals → ProfileSummary, which violates the specified placement.",
