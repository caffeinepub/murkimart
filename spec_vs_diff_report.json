  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 by modifying ProductCard.tsx to display a numeric count (using product.unit and a Hash icon) for egg products, while continuing to show weight with the Scale icon for all other products. The isEggProduct helper checks both category and name case-insensitively. The change is in the single ProductCard component, so it propagates everywhere it is rendered.",
