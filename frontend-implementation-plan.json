For egg products, display a numeric count (e.g., '6 pcs', '12 pcs') with a suitable icon (e.g., Hash or Package icon from lucide-react) instead of the Scale icon and weight. For all other products, preserve the existing weight display with Scale icon. Ensure the count value is derived from the product's weight field (e.g., if weight is '6', display '6 pcs'). The visual styling should remain consistent with the existing design."
